For this project we had to create a printf function using all the concepts that
we learned before, with speciall enphasis in the last two, which were Variadic
Functions and Pointer to functions.

The Prototype we recieved was:
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

In order to achieve the task, we created a header that contains all the
prototypes and the structure type.
Also we created two .c files, which were called "funcion principal" and
"funciones anexas". These files contain the main and secondary functions that
are going to be called when needed, the variadic and structure declaration.

You can also find printf man page with an example.
