.SH DESCRIPTION
.\ A control parametter used by a class of functions in the input/output librari
es of C
.PP
These eight functions write the output under the control of a format string that
 specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-len
The functions in the printf() family produce output according to a format as de
scribed below. The functions printf() and vprintf() write output to stdout, the
 standard output stream; fprintf() and vfprintf() write output to the given out
put stream; sprintf(), snprintf(), vsprintf() and vsnprintf() write to the chara
cter string str.
.PP
The functions vprintf(), vfprintf(), vsprintf(), vsnprintf() are equivalent to t
he functions printf(), fprintf(), sprintf(), snprintf(), respectively, except th
at they are called with a va_list instead of a variable number of arguments. The
se functions do not call the va_end macro. Because they invoke the va_arg macro,
 the value of ap is undefined after the call. See stdarg(3).
.HP

.IP
exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the
command times out
.HP
\fB\-\-foreground\fR
.IP
When not running timeout directly from a shell prompt,
allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and receive TTY signals.
In this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out.
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-kill\-after\fR=\fIDURATION\fR
.IP
also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running
this long after the initial signal was sent.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fISIGNAL\fR
.IP
specify the signal to be sent on timeout.
SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number.
See 'kill \fB\-l\fR' for a list of signals
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
DURATION is a floating point number with an optional suffix:
\&'s' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.
.PP
If the command times out, and \fB\-\-preserve\-status\fR is not set, then exit with
status 124.  Otherwise, exit with the status of COMMAND.  If no signal
is specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills
any process that does not block or catch that signal.  It may be necessary
to use the KILL (9) signal, since this signal cannot be caught, in which
case the exit status is 128+9 rather than 124.
.SH BUGS
Some platforms don't curently support timeouts beyond 2038
